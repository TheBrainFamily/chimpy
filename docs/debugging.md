You can debug your Cucumber tests or Chimpy with the node debugger.

###[Debug Chimpy](#debug-chimpy)

# Debug Chimpy

## 1. Add breakpoints

Use the `debugger;` statement in your code to create a breakpoint. You can place additional breakpoints later in the debugging session with the node-inspector user interface.


## 2. Start chimpy in debug mode

Start chimpy with node in debug mode.

```shell
node --debug --debug-brk `which chimpy`
# or for node 8.0
node --inspect --inspect-brk `which chimpy`
```

Wait until you see `debugger listening on port 5858` in the console.

## 3. Start node-inspector

Install node-inspector.

```shell
npm install node-inspector -g
```

Start node-inspector.

```shell
node-inspector
```

There will be two different debug sessions available.

**Chimpy:** [http://127.0.0.1:8080/?ws=127.0.0.1:8080&port=5858](http://127.0.0.1:8080/?ws=127.0.0.1:8080&port=5858)
**Cucumber** (and your tests): [http://127.0.0.1:8080/?ws=127.0.0.1:8080&port=5859](http://127.0.0.1:8080/?ws=127.0.0.1:8080&port=5859)

First you need to open the [Chimpy debug session](http://127.0.0.1:8080/?ws=127.0.0.1:8080&port=5858). If you don't want to debug Chimpy itself, just press the resume button in the node-inspector user interface.

Wait until you see `debugger listening on port 5859` in the console. Now you can open the [Cucumber debug session](http://127.0.0.1:8080/?ws=127.0.0.1:8080&port=5859). After you have set your breakpoints, press the resume button and wait until a breakpoint hits.

Happy debugging!

# Debug Cucumber (Your Steps)

## 1. Add breakpoints

Use the `debugger;` statement in your code to create a breakpoints. You can place additional breakpoints later in the debugging session with the node-inspector user interface.


## 2. Tell Chimpy to start Cucumber in debug mode

### In Node < 8.0
You can use these command line switched to do that:

```shell
chimpy --debugCucumber
# or
chimpy --debugCucumber=<port>
```

To turn on debug mode and break on start:

```shell
chimpy --debugBrkCucumber
# or
chimpy --debugBrkCucumber=<port>
```

### In Node >= 8.0
You can use these command line switched to do that:

```shell
chimpy --inspectCucumber
# or
chimpy --inspectCucumber=<port>
```

To turn on inspect mode and break on start:

```shell
chimpy --inspectBrkCucumber
# or
chimpy --inspectBrkCucumber=<port>
```

You can then connect your favorite debugger and enjoy!

# Debug Mocha (Your Specs)

# 1. Add breakpoints

Use the `debugger;` statement in your code to create a breakpoints. You can place additional breakpoints later in the debugging session with the node-inspector user interface.


## 2. Tell Chimpy to start Mocha in debug mode

### In Node < 8.0
You can use these command line switched to do that:

```shell
chimpy --debugMocha
# or
chimpy --debugMocha=<port>
```

To use debug mode and break on start use:

```shell
chimpy --debugBrkMocha
# or
chimpy --debugBrkMocha=<port>
```

### In Node >= 8.0
You can use these command line switched to do that:

```shell
chimpy --inspectMocha
# or
chimpy --inspectMocha=<port>
```

To turn on inspect mode and break on start:

```shell
chimpy --inspectBrkMocha
# or
chimpy --inspectBrkMocha=<port>
```
